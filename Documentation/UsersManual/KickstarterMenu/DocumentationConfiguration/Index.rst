- **Extensions**: extensions that will be added in the ``Settings.cfg`` file.

- **Keep Settings.cfg file**: set this option if you ``manually`` modify
  the ``Settings.cfg`` file. It will prevent the SAV Library Kickstarter
  to rebuild it.

  the documentation on your server using ``docker-compose`` from your extension
  directory.

  The ``docker-compose.yml`` is such that the documentation will be 
  generated in the directory ``typo3conf/Documentation`` of your server.

  the Entity Relationship Diagram. The Entity Relationship Diagram is generated by in `Graphviz

  want to generate a full documentation of the configuration of the forms and tables used in your
  extension for SAV Library Plus. 
  
The following figure shows the Entity Relationship Diagram for the extension  
`sav_library_example2 <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/sav_library_example2>`_. 
As it can be seen on the left hand side menu, the documentation includes the form and the tables
used in the extension.
